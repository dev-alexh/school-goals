# school-goals
School goals web project created for students who want to start the semester right by writing down their course goals and how they are going to achieve that A.

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JS

Technologies: Bootstrap 3.4.0

Goal: A personal project developed to help students (in particular students from the University of Toronto) plan for how they can do well in a course. Information submitted will be validated using Regex, stored into a JSON object (stringify) which would then be stored in Local Storage. If the user wants to revisit their school goals, provided that they did not clear their browser data, the information (parsed JSON object) will autopopulate again for the user to view. 

Future improvements: I plan to add more fields for multiple courses. Currently, this project only allows a user to store goals for one course.
